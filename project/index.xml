      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reference genomes and reliable gene predictions are the core of contemporary molecular biology. Recent years have seen a concerted, global effort to increase the availability of reference genomes for parasitic worms and their vectors. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://parasite.wormbase.org/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WormBase ParaSite&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.vectorbase.org/vectorbase.beta/app/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;VectorBase&lt;/a&gt; now house hundreds of worm, mosquito, and snail reference genomes, as well as a considerable amount of data from associated cell lines, wild isolates, and lab strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of my work is facilitated by the community&amp;rsquo;s investment in these data sources, so it is right for me to likewise contribute, not only for the advancement of my own research interests, but for the utilization of the field as a whole. I have been involved in international consortiums and have lead lab projects to increase to amount and quality of these genomic sources. Contributions, publications, and public access links are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Helminth Sensation and Migration</title>
      <link>https://wheelern.github.io/project/chemosensation/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sensation of a parasite&amp;rsquo;s environment is absolutely critical to successful transmission and continuation of the parasite&amp;rsquo;s life cycle. Vector-borne helminths like schistosomes and filarial nematodes have precisely evolved neurologic and receptor modalities that allow for the integration of multimodal afferent information, such as a worm&amp;rsquo;s chemical, physical, and thermal environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, mosquito-borne filarial worm larvae are ingested during a blood meal by a mosquito, after which the larvae must quickly escape the blood in order to elude the innate immunity in the mosquito midgut. Worms leave the midgut and enter the hemocoel, and then become intracellular in either the thoracic musculature or Malphigian tubules, depending on species. After development, they migrate to the head region and proboscis in preparation for departure during the next blood meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schistosomes, on the other hand, play a more active role during larval infections. Miracidia hatch from eggs in water, and they have a limited amount of energy stored to use for the detection and invasion of competent snails. Likewise, transformed cercaria depart the snail and must infect a compatible mammal, using chemical and thermal cues along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples are just a snippet of the migrations that filarial worms and schistosomes perform during their life cycles; further chemotaxis is likely performed once in their human hosts. How do the worms do it? They are relatively simple creatures, yet they reliably and repeatedly perform these heroic migrations. This is one of the driving questions for my research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these migrations are endlessly fascinating, elucidating the molecular receptors that are involved in environmental sensation could also lead to creative ways for approaching parasite control. What if we designed a &amp;ldquo;scentless&amp;rdquo; snail that was hidden from miracidia? What if we could synthesize a salve that could confuse infective filarial and schistosome larvae? Admittedly these would be ambitious projects, but elimination of these debilitating and widespread diseases may require such ambition&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Helminth GPCRs</title>
      <link>https://wheelern.github.io/project/gpcrs/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://wheelern.github.io/project/gpcrs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost all anthelmintics (drugs used to treat helminth infections in humans and animals) target ion channels (see this 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_anthelminticdrugs/anthelminticdrugs.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WormBook article&lt;/a&gt; for more information on anthelmintics and their targets). Ion channels are often fast acting signal transduction channels that operate at the neuromuscular junction and are often activated by neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One motiviating hypothesis that we have is that the next-generation of anthelmintics will target GPCRs instead of ion channels. Currently, only two drugs, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cell.com/trends/parasitology/pdf/S1471-4922%2818%2930009-6.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;praziquantel&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00436-005-1438-z&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;emodepside&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; target G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), but they likely aren&amp;rsquo;t their only targets. Unfortunately, there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a novel anthelmintic developed in decades, and we think a focus should be given to new receptor targets like GPCRs. GPCRs are classically believed to be more slow acting than ion channels and function in sensitive neuromodulation, but that isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily true for helminths. Neuropeptides can cause direct muscular contraction through a GPCR, and so can neurotransmitters [Day and Ribeiro citations].&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Snail Transgenesis</title>
      <link>https://wheelern.github.io/project/snail_transgenesis/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Schistosomiasis is a widespread and burdensome neglected tropical disease (NTD) that inflicts massive morbidity on the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people. This infection, caused by parasitic flatworms of the genus &lt;em&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/em&gt;, is increasingly controlled by mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel (PZQ), which is effective at quickly clearing adults from the patient’s vasculature. Regional and nationalized intervention through MDA has substantially reduced the global burden of schistosomiasis in the past +20 years, but a prevalence of nearly 200 million remains. The 2012 London Declaration on NTDs initiated a collaboration between public and private entities, including Merck KGaA, that set a goal to control schistosomiasis by 2020. This will primarily be achieved by the spread and optimization of MDA, but recent models show that the collaboration will likely fall short unless MDA is greatly expanded in high prevalence areas. Such an expansion would increase the already significant fear of the proliferation of PZQ resistance in local &lt;em&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/em&gt; spp. populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fears scaffold the argument that schistosomiasis control ought to have an integrated, multifaceted approach that includes MDA, education, and vector control. Control of the freshwater snail vector of Schistosoma spp., including species of the genera &lt;em&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bulinus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Oncomelania&lt;/em&gt;, has classically been performed by biological agents, molluscicidal treatment, or habitat reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advent of genome editing technology has enabled the development of new methods of vector control. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in combination with the endogenous homologous repair mechanism and incorporation of synthetic repair templates, gene drives can be designed to spread synthetic constructs throughout a vector population through super-Mendelian inheritance. If the chosen trait is deleterious for the organism, the trait will be driven to fixation and the population will slowly crash (population suppression). Likewise, if the trait confers resistance to the pathogen such that it cannot properly develop, the pathogen will be unable to continue its life cycle and have its infective stage transmitted to the human host (population replacement). These ideas have primarily been promulgated as a control measure for pests or insects that bear parasitic and viral pathogens, but the idea has recently been suggested as a new measure for snail control. Unfortunately, the methods for transgenesis that are necessary for such techniques are not standard in snails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Merck Global Health Institute, in collaboration with researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and other consultants, has undertaken the task of developing the tools to achieve the aim of genome editing in &lt;em&gt;B. glabrata&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
