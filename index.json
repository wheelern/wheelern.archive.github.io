The nematode parasites (Nematoda: Filarioidea) that cause LF require both arthropod (mosquito) intermediate hosts and mammalian definitive hosts for their propagation. The invasion and migration of filarial worms through host tissues are complex and critical to survival, yet little is known about the receptors and signaling pathways that mediate directed migration in these medically important species. In order to better understand the role of chemosensory signaling in filarial worm taxis, we employ comparative genomics, transcriptomics, reverse genetics, and chemical approaches to identify putative chemosensory receptor proteins and perturb chemotaxis phenotypes in filarial worms. We find that chemoreceptor family size is correlated with the presence of environmental (extra-host) stages in nematode life cycles, and that filarial worms contain a compact and highly-diverged chemoreceptor complement and lineage-specific ion channels that are predicted to operate downstream of chemoreceptor activation. In *Brugia malayi*, an etiological agent of LF, chemoreceptor expression patterns correspond to distinct parasite migration events across the life cycle. To interrogate the role of chemosensation in the migration of larval worms, arthropod infectious stage (microfilariae) and mammalian infectious stage (L3) *Brugia* parasites were incubated in nicotinamide, an agonist of the nematode transient receptor potential (TRP) channel OSM-9. Exposure of microfilariae to nicotinamide alters intra-mosquito migration while exposure of L3s reduces chemotaxis towards host-associated cues in vitro. Nicotinamide also potently modulates thermosensory responses in L3s, suggesting a polymodal sensory role for *Brugia* osm-9. Reverse genetic studies implicate both *Brugia osm-9* and the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel subunit *tax-4* in larval chemotaxis towards host serum, and these ion channel subunits rescue sensory defects in *C. elegans osm-9* and *tax-4* knock-out strains. Together, these data reveal genetic and functional diversification of chemosensory signaling proteins in filarial worms, and encourage a more thorough investigation of clade and parasite-specific facets of nematode sensory receptor biology.","tags":["Chemosensation","GPCRs"],"title":"Genetic and functional diversification of chemosensory pathway receptors in mosquito-borne filarial nematodes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Theresa Maier, **Nicolas J.

Although mass drug administration is a cost-effective approach to reduce occurrence, extent, and severity of the disease, it does not provide protection to subsequent reinfection. Interventions that target the parasitesâ€™ intermediate snail hosts are a crucial part of the integrated strategy required to move toward disease elimination. The recent revolution in gene drive technology naturally leads to questions about whether gene drives could be used to efficiently spread schistosome resistance traits in a population of snails and whether gene drives have the potential to contribute to reduced disease transmission in the long run. Responsible implementation of gene drives will require solutions to complex challenges spanning multiple disciplines, from biology to policy. This Review Article presents collected perspectives from practitioners of global health, genome engineering, epidemiology, and snail/schistosome biology and outlines strategies for responsible gene drive technology development, impact measurements of gene drives for schistosomiasis control, and gene drive governance. Success in this arena is a function of many factors, including gene-editing specificity and efficiency, the level of resistance conferred by the gene drive, how fast gene drives may spread in a metapopulation over a complex landscape, ecological sustainability, social equity, and, ultimately, the reduction of infection prevalence in humans. With combined efforts from across the broad global health community, gene drives for schistosomiasis control could fortify our defenses against this devastating disease in the future.","tags":["Snails","Collaborations"],"title":"Gene drives for schistosomiasis transmission control","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"877e27305d1c9693d291e94fcdc544e0","permalink":"https://wheelern.github.io/talk/uww2019/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/uww2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"New insights into neglected diseases","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1540598400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540598400,"objectID":"afcf4717a671232ba993d4b220fc6c0d","permalink":"https://wheelern.github.io/talk/gsa2018/","publishdate":"2018-10-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/gsa2018/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Progress toward transgenesis in Biomphalaria glabrata and implications for snail control.","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This page is a work in progress!\n","date":1539475200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539475200,"objectID":"b92707f070c6ef18d261c0ab057b8355","permalink":"https://wheelern.github.io/project/genomics/","publishdate":"2018-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/genomics/","section":"project","summary":"Using short and long-read sequencing technologies to improve the available sequence datasets for helminths and parasite vectors.","tags":["Genomics"],"title":"Helminth and Vector Genomics","type":"project"},{"authors":["**Nicolas J.

Much is known regarding the host-parasite interactions of these two organisms, and the *B. glabrata* embryonic (Bge) cell line has been an invaluable resource in these studies. The *B. glabrata* BB02 genome sequence was recently released, but nothing is known of the sequence variation between this reference and the Bge cell genome, which has likely accumulated substantial genetic variation in the ~50 years since its isolation. **Results:** Here, we report the genome sequence of our laboratory subculture of the Bge cell line (designated Bge3), which we mapped to the *B. glabrata* BB02 reference genome. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were predicted and focus was given to those SNVs that are most likely to affect the structure or expression of protein-coding genes. Furthermore, we have highlighted and validated high-impact SNVs in genes that have often been studied using Bge cells as an *in vitro* model, and other genes that may have contributed to the immortalization of this cell line. We also resolved representative karyotypes for the Bge3 subculture, which revealed a mixed population exhibiting substantial aneuploidy, in line with previous reports from other Bge subcultures. **Conclusions:** The Bge3 genome differs from the *B. glabrata* BB02 reference genome in both sequence and structure, and these are likely to have significant biological effects. The availability of the Bge3 genome sequence, and an awareness of genomic differences with *B. glabrata*, will inform the design of experiments to understand gene function in this unique in vitro snail cell model. Additionally, this resource will aid in the development of new technologies and molecular approaches that promise to reveal more about this schistosomiasis-transmitting snail vector.","tags":["Snails","Genomics","Collaborations"],"title":"Sequence and structural variation in the genome of the Biomphalaria glabrata embryonic (Bge) cell line","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1533168000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533168000,"objectID":"39fa545bfd37d58a912e6b9e4bedc703","permalink":"https://wheelern.github.io/talk/schisto_symposium2018/","publishdate":"2018-08-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/schisto_symposium2018/","section":"talk","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Progress toward transgensis in Biomphalaria glabrata","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This page is a work in progress!\n","date":1532822400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532822400,"objectID":"78444a3fb8016a184e905c308308d625","permalink":"https://wheelern.github.io/project/chemosensation/","publishdate":"2018-07-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/chemosensation/","section":"project","summary":"Many helminths perform heroic migrations throughout the course of their life cycle, especially vector-borne helminths like schistosomes and filarial worms.","tags":["Chemosensation"],"title":"Helminth Chemosensation and Migration","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Almost all anthelmintics (drugs used to treat helminth infections in humans and animals) target ion channels (see this WormBook article for more information on anthelmintics and their targets).

Because medical treatment is currently based on a single drug, praziquantel, there is urgent need for the development of alternative control strategies. The *Schistosoma mansoni* genome project provides a platform to study and connect the genetic repertoire of schistosomes to specific biological functions essential for successful parasitism. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) form the largest superfamily of transmembrane receptors throughout the Eumetazoan phyla, including platyhelminths. Due to their involvement in diverse biological processes, their pharmacological importance, and proven druggability, GPCRs are promising targets for new anthelmintics. However, to identify candidate receptors, a more detailed understanding of the roles of GPCR signalling in schistosome biology is essential. An updated phylogenetic analysis of the *S. mansoni* GPCR genome (GPCRome) is presented, facilitated by updated genome data that allowed a more precise annotation of GPCRs. Additionally, we review the current knowledge on GPCR signalling in this parasite and provide new insights into the potential roles of GPCRs in schistosome reproduction based on the findings of a recent tissue-specific transcriptomic study in paired and unpaired *S. mansoni*. According to the current analysis, GPCRs contribute to gonad-specific functions but also to nongonad, pairing-dependent processes. The latter may regulate gonad-unrelated functions during the multifaceted male-female interaction. Finally, we compare the schistosome GPCRome to that of another parasitic trematode, *Fasciola*, and discuss the importance of GPCRs to basic and applied research. Phylogenetic analyses display GPCR diversity in free-living and parasitic platyhelminths and suggest diverse functions in schistosomes. Although their roles need to be substantiated by functional studies in the future, the data support the selection of GPCR candidates for basic and applied studies, invigorating the exploitation of this important receptor class for drug discovery against schistosomes but also other trematodes.","tags":["Reviews","Collaborations","GPCRs"],"title":"Tissue-specific transcriptome analyses provide new insights into GPCR signalling in adult Schistosoma mansoni","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Schistosomiasis is a widespread and burdensome neglected tropical disease (NTD) that inflicts massive morbidity on the worldâ€™s poorest and most vulnerable people. This infection, caused by parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistosoma, is increasingly controlled by mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel (PZQ), which is effective at quickly clearing adults from the patientâ€™s vasculature. Regional and nationalized intervention through MDA has substantially reduced the global burden of schistosomiasis in the past +20 years, but a prevalence of nearly 200 million remains. The 2012 London Declaration on NTDs initiated a collaboration between public and private entities, including Merck KGaA, that set a goal to control schistosomiasis by 2020. This will primarily be achieved by the spread and optimization of MDA, but recent models show that the collaboration will likely fall short unless MDA is greatly expanded in high prevalence areas. Such an expansion would increase the already significant fear of the proliferation of PZQ resistance in local Schistosoma spp. populations.\nThese fears scaffold the argument that schistosomiasis control ought to have an integrated, multifaceted approach that includes MDA, education, and vector control. Control of the freshwater snail vector of Schistosoma spp., including species of the genera Biomphalaria, Bulinus, and Oncomelania, has classically been performed by biological agents, molluscicidal treatment, or habitat reduction.\nThe advent of genome editing technology has enabled the development of new methods of vector control. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in combination with the endogenous homologous repair mechanism and incorporation of synthetic repair templates, gene drives can be designed to spread synthetic constructs throughout a vector population through super-Mendelian inheritance. If the chosen trait is deleterious for the organism, the trait will be driven to fixation and the population will slowly crash (population suppression). Likewise, if the trait confers resistance to the pathogen such that it cannot properly develop, the pathogen will be unable to continue its life cycle and have its infective stage transmitted to the human host (population replacement). These ideas have primarily been promulgated as a control measure for pests or insects that bear parasitic and viral pathogens, but the idea has recently been suggested as a new measure for snail control. Unfortunately, the methods for transgenesis that are necessary for such techniques are not standard in snails.\nThe Merck Global Health Institute, in collaboration with researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and other consultants, has undertaken the task of developing the tools to achieve the aim of genome editing in B. glabrata.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"cfca03aea8e9220c9ec8cf885ccf0623","permalink":"https://wheelern.github.io/project/snail_transgenesis/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/snail_transgenesis/","section":"project","summary":"A collaboration between the Merck KGaA Global Health Institute and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.","tags":["Snail"],"title":"Snail Transgenesis","type":"project"},{"authors":["**Nicolas J.

While basic research on parasitic flatworms (platyhelminths) continues to expand, researchers have yet to broadly adopt a free-living model to complement the study of these important parasites. METHODS: We report the high-coverage sequencing (RNA-Seq) and assembly of the transcriptome of the planarian Girardia tigrina across a set of dynamic conditions. The assembly was annotated and extensive orthology analysis was used to seed a pipeline for the rational prioritization and validation of putative anthelmintic targets. A small number of targets conserved between parasitic and free-living flatworms were comparatively interrogated. RESULTS: 240 million paired-end reads were assembled de novo to produce a strictly filtered predicted proteome consisting of over 22,000 proteins. Gene Ontology annotations were extended to 16,467 proteins. 2,693 sequences were identified in orthology groups spanning flukes, tapeworms and planaria, with 441 highlighted as belonging to druggable protein families. Chemical inhibitors were used on three targets in pharmacological screens using both planaria and schistosomula, revealing distinct motility phenotypes that were shown to correlate with planarian RNAi phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides the first comprehensive and annotated sequence resource for the model planarian G. tigrina, alongside a prioritized list of candidate drug targets conserved among parasitic and free-living flatworms. As proof of principle, we show that a simple RNAi and pharmacology pipeline in the more convenient planarian model system can inform parasite biology and serve as an efficient screening tool for the identification of lucrative anthelmintic targets.","tags":["Genomics"],"title":"Functional analysis of Girardia tigrina transcriptome seeds pipeline for anthelmintic target discovery.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mostafa Zamanian, Prince N.

We validate and describe an alternative loss-of-function approach for ascertaining the ligand and G protein coupling properties of GPCRs in their native cell membrane environment. Our efforts are focused on the phylum *Platyhelminthes*, given the heavy health burden exacted by pathogenic flatworms, as well as the role of free-living flatworms as model organisms for the study of developmental biology. RNA interference (RNAi) was used in conjunction with a biochemical endpoint assay to monitor cAMP modulation in response to the translational suppression of individual receptors. As proof of principle, this approach was used to confirm the neuropeptide GYIRFamide as the cognate ligand for the planarian neuropeptide receptor GtNPR-1, while revealing its endogenous coupling to GÎ±(i/o). The method was then extended to deorphanize a novel GÎ±(s)-coupled planarian serotonin receptor, DtSER-1. A bioinformatics protocol guided the selection of receptor candidates mediating 5-HT-evoked responses. These results provide functional data on a neurotransmitter central to flatworm biology, while establishing the great potential of an RNAi-based deorphanization protocol.
